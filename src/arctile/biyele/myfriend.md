`It's been a long day without you my friend`

`And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again`

`We've come a long way from where we began`

`Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again`

`When I see you again  Damn who knew all the planes we flew`

`Good things we've been through`

`That I'll be standing right here`

`Talking to you about another path`

`I know we loved to hit the road and laugh`

`But something told me that it wouldn't last`

`Had to switch up look at things`

`different see the bigger picture`

`Those were the days hard work forever pays`
